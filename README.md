# leetcli ‚Äî A Modern LeetCode Command Line Tool

`leetcli` is a powerful and intuitive command-line tool built in **C++17** that allows you to interact with LeetCode directly from your terminal. Whether you're preparing for interviews or grinding through problems, `leetcli` makes the process faster and more developer-friendly.

## üöÄ Tech Stack
- **C++17** ‚Äî fast, efficient, and portable
- **[cpr](https://github.com/libcpr/cpr)** ‚Äî a modern C++ HTTP client library used for interacting with LeetCode's REST and GraphQL APIs
- **[nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)** ‚Äî easy-to-use JSON parsing for handling API data
- **Google Gemini API** ‚Äî used for AI-powered features like runtime analysis and intelligent hints

## ‚ú® Features
- üìù **Fetch problems** (including the daily question)
- üß† **AI-powered analysis** (runtime complexity + hints via Gemini)
- üíª **Edit solutions in your preferred language** (C++, Python, Java)
- ‚úÖ **Run solutions remotely on LeetCode** with real test cases
- üì§ **Submit solutions** directly from the CLI
- üìÇ **Organized project structure** with per-problem folders
- üîë **Session management** for authenticated actions

## ‚öñÔ∏è Initialization
Run `init` once at the root of your development folder:
```sh
leetcli init
```
This command sets up your `leetcli` workspace:
- Creates a `problems/` folder in the current directory to store fetched problems.
- Asks you to choose your preferred programming language (`cpp`, `python`, `java`), which is used as the default when fetching problems.
- Saves configuration in a `.leetcli_config.json` file.

Additionally, you'll want to authorize your LeetCode session to enable features like problem submission and test running:
- Run the login command:
  ```sh
  leetcli login
  ```
- You'll be prompted to enter your LeetCode session token and CSRF token, which are stored securely for future use.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration
To set your Gemini API key:
```sh
leetcli config set-gemini-key <your-gemini-key>
```
